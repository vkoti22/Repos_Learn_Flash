# Process
The follow steps outline the process for Data Permissions in API:
- A wrapper is added which runs a regular process like **auth**, getting data from DB & other business logic. 
- Once the response is ready, then the data permission will be applied at the field level. 
- Furthermore, if user has the correct permission:
	- (1) then user will get the data.
	- (2) otherwise/else data will be scrubbed from response and user will get a restricted text instead of actual value (i.e. unicode for lock emoji). 
		- The restricted text is configurable per service.

*The diagram displays the Processing for Data Permissions in API*

 1. Get Permission Config from COTS.
 2. Get User Data Permission in a given context.
 3. Get Permission Config from COTS specific for a study.
 4. Check if User Data Permission matches data permission.
 5. If matches, then user gets **actual** text.
 6. If not-match, then user gets **restricted** text. 

### Further guidance
- As a Developer, you provide the properties on which data restriction need to be applied.
- In the API call, fields not specifically permissioned, (i.e. other fields) in response are treated as **non-restricted** fields. 
- If COTS is missing, then the response is treated as **non-restricted**.

- COTS can process all types of fields:
   - simple field - specific property name (i.e. username)
   - complex field - specific in pattern of parent.child (i.e. user.name)
   - Array - represent array as * (i.e. users[*].name)
